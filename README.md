#Volunteering app

##Description

This is a mobile-responsive page for people who wish to volunteer at an event. It contains details about the event and how they can help, as well as a form to participate.

##Running

To run the app, open the index.html file in a navigator.

##Frameworks

Frameworks used:
- AngularJS
- UI Bootstrap

This page is intended to fit in a larger AngularJS project. It uses UI Bootstrap to prevent using jQuery, as AngularJS already uses jqLite.
