#Volunteering app

##Description

This is a mobile-responsive page for people who wish to volunteer at an event. It contains details about the event and how they can help, as well as a form to participate.

##Running

To run the app, open the index.html file in a navigator.

##Frameworks

Frameworks:
- AngularJS
- Bootstrap

This page is intended to fit in a larger AngularJS project. It uses Bootstrap to get a mobile-responsive page.

Libraries:
- angular-messages.js (Helps write messages for forms)
- jQuery

##Notes

- The values of the form are ready to be stored, as it can be seen in the console. If they are invalid, an error message is shown in the console.
- All the pictures and videos are free for commercial use.
- The best solution would have been to use UI Bootstrap. This is because AngularJS uses jqLite, and we should not have to include jQuery with AngularJS. 
- This site works on the latest versions of Chrome, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Microsoft Edge.
